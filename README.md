Project Description and Goals:<br>
This project is a personal portfolio website showcasing skills, educational background, certifications and featured projects focused on artificial intelligence and web development. The goal here is to create a clean, responsive and accessible platform to present professional work and contact information effectively.<br>

Setup and Running Locally<br>

To run the site locally:<br>
Clone the repository or download the project files.<br>
Open the index.html file directly in any modern web browser for a quick preview.<br>

For a better experience with internal navigation; Run a local web server:<br>

python -m http.server 8000<br>
Open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser.<br>

This ensures proper relative paths and routing across pages.<br>

Design Decisions:<br>
Responsive Grid Layout: The projects section utilizes CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax for dynamic column adjustment based on screen size, providing a seamless experience across devices.<br>
Technologies Used: HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling including responsive design. No JavaScript for simplicity and performance.<br>

Accessibility: Semantic HTML tags and clear navigation improve usability for all users.<br>
